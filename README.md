# uNabto SDK

Nabto provides a full communication infrastructure to allow direct, encrypted communication between clients and IoT devices - the Nabto  communication platform. The platform supports direct peer-to-peer connectivity through NAT traversal.

uNabto (pronounced 'micro nabto') is an open source C framework supplied by Nabto, which can be integrated with your existing device application.

### Documentation

The Nabto documentation is located at http://nabto.com/documentation, where the basics of the Nabto platform is explained. This is a good place to start!

### Source code

The `src` directory contains the uNabto framework source code and device specific config files.

`build/cmake/unabto_files.cmake` sets the build environment used by some of the demos.

`external` is where you put all uNabto externals.

### Demos

The `apps` directory contains uNabto examples for different platforms (e.g. Windows, Unix, Microchip, Arduino, etc.).
